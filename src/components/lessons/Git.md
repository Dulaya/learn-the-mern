## What are Git and Github?

Git is an open source code management system. The basic idea of git is to keep track of different versions of code or text and to check what has changed. Github allows developers to host their files in a repository so that other people can collaborate on projects with them. More info about Git and Github and how to set it up can be found [here](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/f1-u3-git-setup).
